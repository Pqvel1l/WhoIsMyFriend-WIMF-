# WhoIsMyFriend-WIMF

### Never Forget a Face (or a Nickname) Again!

You meet a friendly player named `xX_Miner_Xx` who helps you fight off a creeper swarm. They give you some bread and you go your separate ways. A week later, you see them again, but can't remember the details of your encounter. Was this the person who helped you, or the one who stole your diamonds?

**Who Is My Friends (WIMF)** solves this problem forever.

WIMF is a 100% client-side mod that gives you a comprehensive, in-game notebook for everyone you meet. Manage your friends, allies, and enemies with detailed profiles, all without leaving the comfort of the Minecraft chat.

### Features:

*   **Comprehensive Friend Management:** Easily add, remove, and list your friends through a simple and powerful `/friend` command.
*   **Interactive Chat Interface:** No clunky GUI screens! The entire mod is controlled through a clean, modern chat menu with clickable buttons for navigation, profile viewing, and editing.
*   **Detailed Player Profiles:** The core of WIMF! Each friend has a profile where you can:
    *   Add **multiple, separate notes**. Keep track of trades, shared bases, funny moments, or role-playing history.
    *   Easily add, edit, or remove notes by their ID.
*   **Deep Customization:** Take control of how your friends appear! Use the `/friend setting` command to change the display colors for "Online" and "Offline" statuses using standard color names or HEX codes.
*   **Smart Autocomplete:** Commands are easy to use thanks to built-in suggestions. The mod will suggest online players when adding a new friend, and suggest from your existing friend list when managing a profile.
*   **100% Client-Side:** No server installation required! You can use WIMF on any of your favorite multiplayer servers.

### How to Get Started:
